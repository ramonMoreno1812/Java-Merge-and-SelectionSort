Merge Sort and Selection Sort Algorithms. 

This project sorts two arrays of Integers, and Strings using selection and Merge sort. 
In this project in order for these arrays of different types to be sorted by these two
algorithms, I have allowed my methods to take in "Generic" arrays so I don't have to
create differing methods for differing array types. My sorting methods also implement the
comparable interface so that it may sort generic arrays in one method. The arrays are
printed in random order then in sorted order to the console.
